    "The business objective is to reduce the number of skiers waiting at the bottom of the hill because long lines typically correlate to unhappy customers. Unhappy skiers are not typically repeat customers (\"churn\").\n",

    "Two major assumptions govern this analysis.\n",
    "1. The number of skiers is to remain constant\n",
    "2. Skiers are expected to follow a constant behavioral pattern. Queue for lift, ride lift to top of mountain, ski down the mountain and return to the lift queue. Repeat. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given assumption 1, the actual number of skiers on the mountain is irrelevat. The proportion of skiers at each location on the mountain will be constant at all times. The expected number of skiers will be the product of the number of skiers per minute whom are ascending the mountain and the time spent (in minutes) at each location. The ski lift is \"bottle necking\" the flow of skiers. Therefore, the rate of travel will be constant across all locations, with a queue forming at the base of the mountain as the bottle neck is cleared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given assumption 2, skiers will always be in 1 of 3 ordinal locations: queueing for a ski lift, riding a lift, or skiing down the slopes. The rate and time spent at 2 of the 3 locations have been given for each of the 3 lift options. Therefore, the number of skiers at the 3rd location (the queue) will always be the total number of skiers minus the sum of skiers at the other 2 locations (the lift and the slopes)."
